abstract = {Superpixels are becoming increasingly popular for use in computer vision applications. However, there are few algorithms that output a desired number of regular, compact superpixels with a low com- putational overhead.We introduce a novel algorithm that clusters pixels in the combined five-dimensional color and image plane space to effi- ciently generate compact, nearly uniform superpixels. The simplicity of our approach makes it extremely easy to use a lone parameter specifies the number of superpixels and the efficiency of the algorithm makes it very practical. Experiments show that our approach produces superpix- els at a lower computational cost while achieving a segmentation quality equal to or greater than four state-of-the-art methods, as measured by boundary recall and under-segmentation error.We also demonstrate the benefits of our superpixel approach in contrast to existing methods for two tasks in which superpixels have already been shown to increase per- formance over pixel-based methods.},

abstract = {Wheat diseases are harmful to wheat production, but there are few segmentation algorithms that can effectively identify common diseases of wheat leaves. This paper proposes an automatic and efficient solution with K-means clustering. Firstly, the colour image is transformed to Lab colour space from RGB. Clustering is then done by taking the absolute difference between each pixel and the clustering centre in Lab colour space. Unlike traditional methods, our method does not need manual setting for threshold value and is not affected by the selected channel. Our results show that the segmentation accuracy rates for three common diseases (powdery mildew, leaf rust and stripe rust) is more than 90{\%}, which proves the efficacy of our method.},

@article{Rathore2012,
abstract = {â€” In colour based image segmentation is made to overcome the problems encountered while segmenting an object in a complex scene background by using the colour of the image. After pre-processing, the image is transformed from the RGB colour space to L*a*b* space. Then, the three channels of L*a*b* colour space are separated and a single channel is selected depending upon the colour under consideration. Next, genetic based colour segmentation is performed on the single channel image after which practical is applied to the image to obtain the particular object of interest. As can be seen from the expected results shown in this paper the proposed method is effective in segmenting the complex background images, these results are used to propose a new colour image segmentation method. The proposed method searches for the principal colours, defined as the intersections of the homogeneous blocks of the given image. As such, rather than using the noisy individual pixels, which may contain many outliers, the proposed method uses the linear representation of homogeneous blocks of the image. The paper includes comprehensive mathematical discussion of the proposed method and expected results to show the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.},
